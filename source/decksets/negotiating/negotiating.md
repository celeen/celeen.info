# Negotiating *(Salary)*

---

## **Negotiating** is taking a *calculated risk*

^ research, get familiar with problem space
BUT the result is still unknown until you do it
so it's a risk

^ calculating risk means getting as realistic an idea as you can about the context and what is at steak

---

## _**Manage**_ the Negotiation
## Manage *__the Risk__*

^ There are factors you can control in this process
like the amount you ask for
how you ask for it
familiarity with the problem space gives you power

# [fit] Two _"Simple"_ Steps
# [fit] for a successful negotiation

1. *Figure out what you want*
2. *Ask for it*

---

# Figure out what you want

^ THIS IS SO HARD
this is where you try to gain as much context as possible

---

- *What do other people doing this job make?*
- *What do other people at the company make?*
- *What salary do you want?*
- *What non-monetary do you want?*
- *What does this company/role offer outside of salary?*
- *What engineering experience and competence do you offer?*
- *What non-engineering experience and competence do you offer?*
- *Will you be disapointed if you don't get more money?*
- *Will you be disapointed if the offer is rescinded?*

^ The chances that the offer is rescinded are VERY low, but I do like to consider it minimally.
Recognizing that I wouldn't be lost if that happens gives me more confidence negotiating.

---

# *Ask for it*

---

- Assume positive intent
- Shut away worries
- Be a Nike Posterchild
- If you can ask over the phone, do
