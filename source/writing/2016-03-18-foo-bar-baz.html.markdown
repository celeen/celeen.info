One of Braintree’s top priorities is securing the data our merchants entrust us with. We also want to be aware of implications to merchants and their business. We are still evaluating whether or not the PCI Council’s updated timeline is right for us. However, we also don’t believe it’s appropriate to proceed with deprecating TLS 1.0 on our original timeline. As a result, we are currently postponing deprecation of TLS 1.0 from June 2016 until January 2017. We expect the security landscape in the industry will continue to evolve quickly, so we will re-assess this timeline in September 2016 and provide an update at that time.
